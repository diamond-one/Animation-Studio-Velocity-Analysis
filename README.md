## Introduction
This project analyzes the animation output of three studios—StudioA, StudioB, and StudioC—working on a CG Animated TV Series project. The focus is on identifying disparities in output across different phases (Blocking and Spline) and providing actionable insights to optimize efficiency and standardize output across studios.

## Data Collection Methodology

**Data Sources and Tools:**
The animation output data was collected using Gantt chart software managed by each team's producers. This software tracked the actual time spent per episode, including days spent addressing notes.
- This data was then added to a master Excel file and fed into Power BI to create a relational database for analysis. 

**Timeframe and Scope:**
- The data collection spanned an 18-month period, covering various episodes within the project.

**Challenges and Considerations:**
- One significant challenge was accurately capturing the time spent revisiting old shots to address notes. This often delayed current episodes and was sometimes missed in the data collection process.
- Additionally, metrics were taken for when team members were sick, as this significantly affected output. The impact of sick days varied by studio, with StudioA experiencing a 15% decrease in output, StudioB 10%, and StudioC 20%.

## Stories and Solutions

### Story 1: Disparity in Animation Output Across Studios

**Data Insight:**
- The analysis revealed that StudioA had the highest average output in both Blocking and Spline phases, while StudioC had the lowest. Specifically, StudioA produced 17.4% more output than StudioC in the Blocking phase and 14.5% more in the Spline phase.

**Solution:**
- Implement a cross-studio training program to share best practices and techniques used in StudioA.
- Standardize the workflow processes and tools across studios to minimize disparities.
- Establish clear performance benchmarks and regular monitoring to ensure consistency in output.

### Story 2: The Impact of Team Size on Output Variability

**Data Insight:**
- StudioA's output showed significant variability, potentially due to changes in team size. As the team became smaller, the completion dates became increasingly volatile.

**Solution:**
- Conduct a thorough analysis of team compositions and workloads to identify optimal team sizes.
- Introduce flexible team structures that can be adjusted based on project needs to maintain consistent output.
- Implement a buffer system for staffing, allowing for quick adjustments to team size without impacting the production schedule.

### Story 3: Optimizing Workflow Processes in Different Phases

**Data Insight:**
- The data indicates that each studio has different strengths in various phases. For instance, StudioB is closer to StudioA in the Spline phase but lags behind significantly in the Blocking phase.

**Solution:**
- Analyze the workflows specific to each phase in different studios to identify process inefficiencies.
- Share successful strategies from the Spline phase in StudioA with StudioB to boost their performance in the Blocking phase.
- Develop a unified workflow that incorporates the strengths of each studio, tailored to the unique requirements of each phase.

## Key Insights and Recommendations

- **Standardization and Training:** Establishing uniform processes and continuous training across studios can significantly reduce output variability and improve overall efficiency.
- **Data-Driven Decision Making:** Regularly collecting and analyzing data on team performance can provide actionable insights into optimizing team sizes and workflows.
- **Cross-Functional Collaboration:** Encouraging collaboration and knowledge sharing among studios can lead to a more cohesive and efficient production process.
